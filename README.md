#Booking-React

Its a sample Room Booking system. It allows employees to see which rooms are available with their date and time and to book them as and when they want.

It was developed using [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) technologies.

It supports the following features : -

1. You can see current and future availabilties. 
2. The available room details changes based on the date and room.
3. Clicking on the Room links shows the images and details on the rooms.
4. The preferred room can be booked using the booking button.

Please run *npm install* to install all dependencies and then run *npm start* to start the web app locally.
